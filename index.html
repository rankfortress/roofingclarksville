	<p>
	If you spot some shingles missing from your roof, then there is a high likelihood that some water may have gotten into the interior of the roof. Missing or damaged shingles are common after a heavy storm for strong wind. Do not hesitate to get that fixed because once the water damages the interior of the roof, you may have to do a replacement or very expensive repairs. Fast repairs are the key to a durable roof.
	
	This usually means that the roofing material is getting weak and could have left some parts of the roof exposed. When these parts are exposed rainwater and snow will likely get into the house. Contact Us to inspect the roof, then do some roof repairs.Installing a new roof can be tricky because you need a contractor that is aware of the materials to use for each roof design.

Do not hesitate to call us if you need a roof repair in Clarksville, TN or for the installation of a new roof.
